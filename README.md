# CrunchyRoll-Theme
A Theme for the Wii's Homebrew Channel

# Instructions:

If you installed Homebrew, make a folder called Apps on the root of your sd card.  Then, create a folder and label it CrunchyRoll Theme drag icon.png, meta.xml, and theme.zip into the CrunchyRoll Theme folder.  You will then drag the theme folder into the apps folder.  If done correctly, the icon should show up in the Homebrew channel.  If the icon is missing, it is okay as long as theme.zip and meta.xml are still there.  You will then load up the file like normal and it should load.
